This project started a few months ago, when I realized that many if not all virtual host config files, were outdated and buggy, in the clusters that I manage at the University of Iceland. 

The tool for managing them was gone, and probably no good anyway. 

So I set out with a few design principles: 
* Use few templates and update them. 
* Automatic generation of config files from templates. 
* Use static files for aliases and web redirects. 
* Very fast and easy to set up http, https and redirection. 
* Very fast and easy to change a vhost configuration, back and forth, without losing information. 
* Works for web clusters, as well as for stand alone web servers. 

All operations on file system level as user with some privileges. Create the necessary directory hierarchy: 
$ mkdir -p /etc/httpd/vhosts.d/{alias,scripts,redirect}

Short version: 
$ vhost-create.sh example
$ scripts/example.hi.is_http-www 
$ vhosts-generate.sh
# service httpd restart

A bit more detailed version: 

For site creation: 
$ vhost-create.sh example

This creates a symlink (to a script) with the name of the site and its type. By running the symlink, the script calls the templates according to the type of the website. E.g.: 

$ scripts/example.hi.is_http-www 

Now this creates vhosts files in the directory /etc/httpd/vhosts.d for example.hi.is . Every time the templates are changed or updated, all I have to do is to run all symlinks in the scripts directory. 

The next step is to assign correct IP number to the vhosts and distribute the vhosts files out to each server in the cluster. This is done by the script: 

$ vhosts-generate.sh

Then all you have to do is to reload the server config. 

# service httpd restart
